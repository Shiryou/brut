# Birthright Resource Utility (BRUt)

A library and command line interface to manage resourse files (`.RES`) included with Birthright: The Gorgon's Alliance. It is intended to provide format parity with release versions of the game and standard functionality that might be useful for the modding community. A graphical interface will be added once the library is more mature.
